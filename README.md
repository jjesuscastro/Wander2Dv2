# Wander 2D

Wander 2D is a graphic adventure platformer. It is the final output for the undergraduate thesis ***Promoting Mental Health Awareness Through A Serious Game Utilizing Affective Learning Theories and Aesthetic Emotions***.

The game has 3 worlds, each world is associated with 1 of the 5 main categories of mental health according to DSM V. The 3 worlds are Mood, Anxiety, and Schizophrenia; each world also has a World Keeper that is experiencing or expressing the mental health category associated to the world.

## Getting Started

The project was completed with Unity version **2018.3.5f1**. It is advisable to open the project with the same version to avoid compatibility issues.

**Mental Health Meter**

Throughout the game, the player will encounter puzzles and obstacles that need to be solved to progress. Whenever the player makes a mistake (pitfalls, thorns, etc), the mental health meter depletes.

When the mental health of the player goes below 25%, a trigger will occur. Each world has a unique trigger that is associated to the mental health category it signifies.

**Journal**

The player has the option to collect journals as he/she progresses through the game. The content of each journal page varies on the situation. Some of them provide useful information as what to avoid, while some explain what the avatar feels.
